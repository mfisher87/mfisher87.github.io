title: "Cognitive load"
---

Inspired by an
[amazing talk by Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/10/06/new-talk--making-hard-things-easy/),
I will record tools I use to reduce my cognitive load on this page! My favorites will be
marked with a ‚≠ê!


## Tools

* ‚≠ê [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control is a necessary part of every day
  knowledge work, even if you don't count software.
  **Without tools to help us do version control, we invent our own version control
  systems, and that rarely works out well:**

<!-- alex ignore hooks just -->
* ‚≠ê [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): A tool for sharing
  [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) in a standard
  way.
  This enables linting, formatting, analysis, and more to occur automatically at
  commit-time instead of needing to be operated by a human. I no longer need to think "I
  should remember to lint before committing" (and I often forget); it just happens.
  **Of all the tools I use, nothing has had a larger impact than pre-commit; it enhances
  every single other tool by enabling them to work like magic in the background.**
    * [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/): A free zero-config-required CI service
      for open source projects.
      It runs your pre-existing pre-commit config so even if a contributor doesn't
      install pre-commit, the checks will run on pushed commits.
      This service will also ensure that version numbers in your pre-commit
      configuration are kept up-to-date automatically; one less thing to think about!
* ‚≠ê [Pixi](https://pixi.sh): A new package management tool for conda and PyPI packages.
  It drastically reduces the cognitive load of the typical conda workflow by managing
  your dependency manifest and lockfiles for you.
  It's also fast -- waiting minutes for an environment solve can really mess up your
  working memory.


## Methods

* ‚≠ê Type annotations and checking: When working in a language that doesn't support type
  annotations, I use additional tooling (e.g. Mypy, maybe one day
  [Ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/)) or a transpiled language (e.g. TypeScript) to enable
  type annotation and checking.
  By explicitly documenting and verifying correctness of interfaces, I need to hold less
  information about how different parts of the codebase talk to each other.
* ‚≠ê Vertical space: Intentional vertical space can explicitly indicate boundaries
  between concepts.
  For example, when writing prose I like to write lots of small paragraphs and use lots
  of headers and subheaders to make information hierarchy explicit.
  I also love the
  [one sentence per line](https://nick.groenen.me/notes/one-sentence-per-line/)
  technique when writing markdown -- it's clear when my sentences are too long and when
  I am writing redundantly.
* Early returns/raises: Put exceptions first, and core business logic last.
  Which is easier to understand?

  ```python
  if not is_ready:
      raise NotReadyException
  if not is_set:
      raise NotSetException

  # Business logic: go!
  ```

  Or:

  ```python
  if is_ready and is_set:
      # Business logic: go!
  elif not is_ready:
      raise NotReadyException
  elif not is_set:
      raise NotSetException
  ```

* Pair programming: There's no better way to understand where cognitive load is a
  problem in your codebase or writing than pair programming and listening to another
  human's perspective.


## Python

I write a lot of Python, and I find these tools reduce my cognitive load and in many
cases, also reduce the amount of typing I have to do, which is good for my health.

<!-- alex ignore just black -->
* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black): Instead of worrying about formatting, which I
  can be very picky about, I focus on the problem I'm trying to solve and let Black
  format for me.
  In contrast with tools I used previously for this purpose (e.g.  Flake8), Black
  doesn't just check my formatting, it fixes it.
  Black is also opinionated, which reduces bikeshedding about formatting on my teams.
* ‚≠ê [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): A Python linter written in Rust.
  Ruff has many new linting rules and has also adopted rules from pre-existing tools.
  Ruff can also auto-fix a significant portion of rule violations.
  I need to spend less thought on setting up rules and finding new linters and plugins,
  and I need to fix fewer problems by hand because Ruff does it for me.
  **In combination with pre-commit and Black, I feel like I've reached an almost perfect
  state in which I'm not distracted by my tools and can focus purely on solving problems
  while my tools do magical things like upgrade my code to use new features in new
  Python releases.**
* ‚≠ê [Python type annotations & checker](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html):
  While Python is known to be readable, it's possible to write hard-to-read Python.
  One way is by naming variables ambiguously and passing those variables through a deep
  stack of function calls.
  To debug an inner function's behavior, I have to debug or climb my way up the stack to
  reason about what's being passed in.
  **Type annotations enable verifiable self-documentation, so I don't have to
  investigate to understand what kind of data I'm working with**.


## JavaScript

I don't write JavaScript that often, but when I do:

* ‚≠ê [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): I find JavaScript code requires a
  lot of cognitive load to read, but **with the addition of typing, I find it's both
  easier to read and write clean JavaScript.**
  I will almost always write TypeScript over JavaScript.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): I use this for the same reason I use Ruff.


## Bash

I used to write a lot more Bash than I do now, so I've forgotten a lot of the Bash
trivia I used to have memorized.
Thankfully, I have tools to help me ü§ì

* [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/): As mentioned in Julia's talk, Shellcheck
  knows most of Bash's "gotchas" and frees you to worry about your problems instead of
  Bash's problems.
