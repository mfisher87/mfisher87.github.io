My role on this project was to restore it to working order. I feel strongly that quality
(perceptually uniform) colormaps are critical to science communication and
accessibility, so I was not happy with the _viscm_ being inactive and broken.

I reached out to one of the original developers to request maintainership, and then
collaborated closely with them to deliver significant modernization, code refactoring,
and bugfixes necessary to restoring the project.

After successfully reviving _viscm_, I remained a maintainer.
